# Content Strategy

Microcopy, help text, empty states, error messages, and tone of voice — the words that make or break the user experience.

## TL;DR

- **Words are UI** — Every button label, error message, and empty state shapes user confidence and task completion
- **Every empty state is an opportunity** — Guide users to action, explain what's missing, or offer recovery paths
- **Error messages should be actionable** — Tell users what happened, why it happened, and what to do next in plain language
- **Start with best-practices.md** — Establish content standards before writing copy, not after
- **Consistency is critical** — Create a terminology glossary and enforce it through linting and code review

## Perspectives

- [Product Perspective](product.md) — Business value, user flows, personas, success metrics
- [Architecture](architecture.md) — Content management patterns, i18n implementation, dynamic content, versioning
- [Testing](testing.md) — Content accuracy, accessibility, translation readiness, QA strategies

- [Error Handling](../facets/error-handling.md) — Error messages are a core content type; error handling patterns inform content structure
- [Accessibility](../facets/accessibility.md) — Content must be accessible: meaningful link text, proper labels, screen reader support

## Related Experiences
