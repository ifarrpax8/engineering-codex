# Design Consistency & Visual Identity

Ensuring a cohesive, predictable UI that builds user trust and reduces cognitive load across the entire application.

## TL;DR

- **Default approach**: Adopt an existing design system like Propulsion or MUI rather than building from scratch
- **Key principle**: Consistency beats aesthetics—users trust predictable interfaces more than beautiful but inconsistent ones
- **Common gotcha**: "Just this one exception" snowballs into design system fragmentation across teams
- **Start here**: See [architecture.md](architecture.md) for design token architecture and component library integration patterns
