Comprehensive systems for collecting user feedback, providing in-app help, managing support tickets, and maintaining knowledge bases in B2B SaaS applications.

## TL;DR

- **Always accessible feedback**: Provide in-app feedback mechanisms that capture context automatically (URL, user, browser, screenshots) with minimal friction—ideally 1-2 clicks to submit
- **Close the loop**: Acknowledge every submission immediately, provide ticket numbers, and notify users when their issues are resolved or features are shipped
- **Contextual help over generic FAQs**: Show relevant help content based on the current page or action, rather than forcing users to search through generic documentation
- **Multi-tenant awareness**: Ensure feedback and support channels are properly isolated per tenant, with appropriate admin vs end-user support paths
- **Self-service first**: Invest in knowledge bases, searchable help content, and contextual tooltips to reduce support ticket volume while improving user satisfaction
