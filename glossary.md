# Glossary

Shared terminology used throughout the Engineering Codex. Terms are listed alphabetically.

## A

- **ABAC** -- Attribute-Based Access Control. Authorization based on attributes of the user, resource, and environment.
- **ADR** -- Architecture Decision Record. A document capturing a significant architectural decision, its context, and consequences.
- **API Contract** -- A formal specification of an API's interface, including endpoints, request/response schemas, and behavior guarantees.

## B

- **Best Practice (mode)** -- An `options.md` recommendation type where there is a clear industry consensus. Alternatives are listed as escape hatches.
- **Bounded Context** -- A DDD concept defining a boundary within which a particular domain model applies.

## C

- **CQRS** -- Command Query Responsibility Segregation. Separating read and write models for a system.
- **Cross-Reference** -- A link from one facet or experience to another, indicating a relationship between concerns.

## D

- **Decision Matrix (mode)** -- An `options.md` recommendation type where multiple approaches are genuinely viable and context determines the best choice.
- **DDD** -- Domain-Driven Design. An approach to software design that centers on the core domain and domain logic.

## E

- **Evolution Trigger** -- A specific condition (team size, traffic scale, complexity) that signals a decision should be reconsidered.
- **Experience** -- A user-centric perspective in the codex (e.g., onboarding, navigation). Focuses on what the user sees and feels.

## F

- **Facet** -- An engineering-focused perspective in the codex (e.g., authentication, testing). Focuses on how things are built.
- **Feature Toggle** -- A mechanism to enable or disable features at runtime without deploying new code.

## I

- **Inflection Point** -- A threshold in application growth where the current architecture becomes a bottleneck and evolution is warranted.

## M

- **MFE** -- Micro-Frontend. An architectural pattern where a frontend application is decomposed into smaller, independently deployable units.
- **Modulith** -- A modular monolith. A single deployment unit with well-defined internal module boundaries.

## O

- **Optimistic UI** -- A UX pattern where the interface assumes an action will succeed and updates immediately, reverting only on failure.

## P

- **Perspective** -- One of the five files within a facet or experience: product, architecture, testing, best-practices, options.

## R

- **RBAC** -- Role-Based Access Control. Authorization based on roles assigned to users.

## S

- **SLO** -- Service Level Objective. A target value for a service reliability metric.
- **Synergy** -- A relationship between decisions in different facets where one choice makes another more or less favorable.

## T

- **Three Amigos** -- A collaborative refinement practice involving developer, tester, and product perspectives.
