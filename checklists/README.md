# Checklists

Quick-reference checklists for common development scenarios. Each item links to the relevant facet or experience for the full deep dive.

## Available Checklists

| [Incident Response](incident-response.md) | Responding to a production incident |

## How to Use

1. Open the relevant checklist for your scenario
2. Work through each item -- check off what's already covered, note what's missing
3. For any item that needs more depth, follow the link to the relevant facet or experience
4. Use the `evaluate-options` skill if a checklist item requires a decision
