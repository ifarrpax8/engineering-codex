# Work Management

Ticket systems, ticket types, workflows, estimation, sprint management, backlog grooming.

## TL;DR

- **Default choice**: GitHub Issues for small to medium teams (< 20 developers), Jira for larger teams or enterprise needs, Azure Boards if already in Azure DevOps ecosystem
- **Key principle**: Process discipline matters more than tool choice; choose tools that support your team's practices, not tools that require changing practices to fit
- **Watch out for**: Over-configuration leading to process bloat, tickets becoming a burden engineers avoid, estimation becoming performance evaluation
- **Start here**: [Options](options.md) — contains the decision matrix comparing ticket systems, estimation approaches, and workflow complexity options

- [Product Perspective](product.md) -- Business value, user flows, personas
- [Architecture](architecture.md) -- Patterns, diagrams, trade-offs
- [Testing](testing.md) -- Test strategies, tooling categories
- [Best Practices](best-practices.md) -- Language-agnostic principles
- [Gotchas](gotchas.md) -- Common pitfalls and traps
- [Options](options.md) -- Decision matrix or recommended practice
