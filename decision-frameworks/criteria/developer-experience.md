# Developer Experience

Evaluation criterion for decision matrices across the Engineering Codex.

## Definition

The impact of the chosen approach on developer productivity, satisfaction, and cognitive load during day-to-day development work.

## What to Evaluate

- **Learning curve** -- How long does it take a developer to become productive with this approach?
- **Tooling support** -- Are there good IDE plugins, linters, formatters, and debugging tools?
- **Local development** -- How easy is it to run and test locally?
- **Feedback loop speed** -- How fast is the build-test-verify cycle?
- **Error messages** -- Are errors clear and actionable, or cryptic and misleading?
- **Team familiarity** -- Does the team already have experience with this approach? (See [stack-context.md](../../stack-context.md))
- **Boilerplate** -- How much repetitive code is required?

## Scoring Guide

- **High** -- Minimal learning curve, excellent tooling, fast feedback loops, clear error messages. Team is already familiar.
- **Medium** -- Moderate learning curve, adequate tooling, reasonable feedback loops. Some team members have experience.
- **Low** -- Steep learning curve, limited tooling, slow feedback loops, or poor error messages. No team experience.

## Important Consideration

Developer experience is not about choosing the "easiest" option. It's about choosing the option that lets developers focus on solving business problems rather than fighting their tools. A slightly harder-to-learn approach that pays off in daily productivity is often the right choice.
